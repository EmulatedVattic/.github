# As of December 29th, 2021, Emulated Vattic Textures has rebranded to Classic Faithful, along with all of our projects.

Faithful was never officially licensed to xMrVizzy, also known as Kraineff, for use or for commercial gain. As such, Vattic has asked him to cease and desist use of the Faithful name, remove it from the Minecraft Bedrock Marketplace, and cease development of his version of the pack. Vattic has turned over use to the makers of Classic Faithful (Formerly EM) and Compliance (Now Faithful) to continue Faithful officially as a community-run project.

# What does this mean?

- EM32T has been rebranded to Classic Faithful 32x
- EM32D has been rebranded to Classic Faithful 32x Jappa
- EM64D has been rebranded to Classic Faithful 64x Jappa

There will not be any changes to EM aside from branding—the textures and art direction will continue to remain the same.

## Our new GitHub organization is at https://github.com/ClassicFaithful with our main site at https://faithfulpack.net.
